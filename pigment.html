      <h2>Understanding Pigments</h2>
      <p>
        Pigments are substances that provide color to materials. They are widely used in products like paints, plastics, cosmetics, textiles, and inks. Unlike dyes, pigments are typically insoluble and provide lasting coloration due to their physical and chemical stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pigments can be natural or synthetic, and are generally categorized into organic and inorganic pigments. Organic pigments offer vibrant hues, while inorganic ones are known for their durability and resistance to light and heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their importance spans across industries due to their ability to enhance aesthetic appeal and provide functional qualities like UV protection and corrosion resistance.
