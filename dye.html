      <h2>Understanding Dyes</h2>
      <p>
        Dyes are colorants that dissolve in liquids and impart vibrant colors to a wide variety of materials, especially textiles. Unlike pigments, dyes are absorbed into the material, creating rich and lasting coloration from within the fibers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dyes are commonly classified into types like reactive dyes, direct dyes, acid dyes, and vat dyes—each designed for different types of fabrics and applications. They are widely used in industries such as textiles, paper, leather, food, cosmetics, and plastics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of their chemical structure, dyes can form strong bonds with materials, allowing for intense and permanent coloring. The choice of dye depends on the material to be colored, the desired properties, and the production process.
